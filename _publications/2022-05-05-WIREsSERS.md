Abstract
------
Continuous long-term intracellular imaging and multiplexed monitoring of biomolecular changes associated with key cellular processes remains a challenge for the scientific community. Recently, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been demonstrated as a powerful spectroscopic tool in the field of biology owing to its significant advantages. Some of these include the ability to provide molecule-specific information with exquisite sensitivity, working with small volumes of precious samples, real-time monitoring, and optimal optical contrast. More importantly, the availability of a large number of novel Raman reporters with narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM) of spectral peaks/vibrational modes than conventional fluorophores has created a versatile palette of SERS-based probes that allow targeted multiplex sensing surpassing the detection sensitivity of even fluorescent probes. Due to its nondestructive nature, its applicability has been recognized for biological sensing, molecular imaging, and dynamic monitoring of complex intracellular processes. We critically discuss recent developments in this area with a focus on different applications where SERS has been used for obtaining information that remains elusive for conventional imaging methods. Current reports indicate that SERS has made significant inroads in the field of biology and has the potential to be used for in vivo human applications.
