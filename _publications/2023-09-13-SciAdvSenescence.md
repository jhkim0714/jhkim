Abstract
------
Anticancer therapy screening in vitro identifies additional treatments and improves clinical outcomes. Systematically, although most tested cells respond to cues with apoptosis, an appreciable portion enters a senescent state, a critical condition potentially driving tumor resistance and relapse. Conventional screening protocols would strongly benefit from prompt identification and monitoring of therapy-induced senescent (TIS) cells in their native form. We combined complementary all-optical, label-free, and quantitative microscopy techniques, based on coherent Raman scattering, multiphoton absorption, and interferometry, to explore the early onset and progression of this phenotype, which has been understudied in unperturbed conditions. We identified TIS manifestations as early as 24 hours following treatment, consisting of substantial mitochondrial rearrangement and increase of volume and dry mass, followed by accumulation of lipid vesicles starting at 72 hours. This work holds the potential to affect anticancer treatment research, by offering a label-free, rapid, and accurate method to identify initial TIS in tumor cells.
