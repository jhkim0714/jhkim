Abstract
------
Multimodal tissue imaging techniques that integrate two complementary modalities are powerful discovery tools for unraveling biological processes and identifying biomarkers of disease. Combining Raman spectroscopic imaging (RSI) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to obtain fused images with the advantages of both modalities has the potential of providing spatially resolved, sensitive, specific biomolecular information, but has so far involved two separate sample preparations, or even consecutive tissue sections for RSI and MALDI MSI, resulting in images with inherent disparities. We have developed RaMALDI, a streamlined, integrated, multimodal imaging workflow of RSI and MALDI MSI, performed on a single tissue section with one sample preparation protocol. We show that RaMALDI imaging of various tissues effectively integrates molecular information acquired from both RSI and MALDI MSI of the same sample, which will drive discoveries in cell biology, biomedicine, and pathology, and advance tissue diagnostics.
