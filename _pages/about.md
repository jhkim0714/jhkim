I am a [School of Engineering Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow](https://engineering.mit.edu/the-mit-postdoctoral-fellowship-program-for-engineering-excellence/) at MIT working with [Loza Tadesse](https://tadesselab.mit.edu/). I study molecular, physical, and mechanical properties of biological cells and tissues using optical microscopies and spectroscopies. I analyze and correlate these features to enable us better understand complex interplay and dynamics of biological systems.

I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University with [Ishan Barman](https://www.barman.wse.jhu.edu/). I previously worked at the mechatronics R&D center of Samsung Electronics, where I worked on developing wafer and photomask inspection systems.

| <img src='/images/ToC_AdvBiol.jpeg' width="180" height="auto" />   | <br> Understanding the differentiation of neuronal cells and the impact of neurotoxic agents is of critical importance, particularly in the context of various neurological disorders and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Neuronal growth and degeneration are complex processes, and the ability to monitor these processes label-free and non-invasively is essential for gaining insights into the cellular responses to external stimuli. In this study, we applied quantitative phase imaging (QPI) to extract and quantify key morphological features of neuronal cells during differentiation and exposure to neurotoxic agents.  |
| <img src='/images/ToC_RaMALDI.jpg' width="180" height="auto" />    | <br> Multimodal imaging is an emerging technique in biomedical/chemical imaging that integrated information acquired by multiple modalities and complements each other. Here, we developed an integrated workflow of Raman spectroscopic imaging (RSI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) conducted on a single sample with one-step preparation method. Our approach, RaMALDI imaging, simplifies the overall multimodal imaging procedure and the integration of molecular information from both RSI and MALDI MSI, thus facilitating the analysis. The resulting multimodal images allow semi-quantitative molecular interpretation of a sample, opening new insights into understanding biological processes and structures, enabled by both RSI and MALDI MSI. |
| <img src='/images/QPI_Senescence.jpg' width="180" height="auto" /> | <br> Cancer therapy is one of the most controversial and poorly understood causes of senescence. We still donâ€™t know whether therapy-induced-senescent cells are beneficial to cancer therapy that help recruiting immune cells or detrimental that add resistance to it. Here, we used quantitative phase microscopy and nonlinear optical modalities to identify and quantify morphological and molecular features and extract physical and chemical properties. This finding holds significance in that it could characterize cellular senescence without any labels targeting senescent biomarkers and quantitively assess morpho-molecular changes due to chemotherapy, presenting the potential for a more accurate approach to managing senescence.     |
| <img src='/images/ToC_Amyloid.jpg' width="180" height="auto" />    | <br> Amyloid deposits, caused by the aggregation of misfolded proteins, serve as an indicator of amyloidosis in various organs, including the kidney. To provide patient-specific treatment, accurate amyloidosis and typing through identifying the constituent precursor proteins is essential. Here, we characterized two of the most common systemic renal amyloidoses, immunoglobulin light-chain and amyloid A amyloidosis, using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning analysis. This approach allows for automated, objective recognition and subtyping of amyloid deposits in unstained kidney tissues.                  |
