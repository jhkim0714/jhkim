I am a postdoctoral fellow at MIT working with [Loza Tadesse](https://tadesselab.mit.edu/) and supported by the [MIT Postdoctoral Fellowship for Engineering Excellence](https://engineering.mit.edu/the-mit-postdoctoral-fellowship-program-for-engineering-excellence/). I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University with [Ishan Barman](https://www.barman.wse.jhu.edu/). I study molecular, physical, and mechanical properties of biological cells and tissues using optical microscopies and spectroscopies. I analyze and correlate these features to enable us better understand complex interplay and dynamics of biological systems.

I previously worked at the mechatronics R&D center of Samsung Electronics, where I worked on developing wafer and photomask inspection systems.

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
